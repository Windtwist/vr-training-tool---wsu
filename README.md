## Requirements

For running project you will need Unity Editor 2021.3.17f1 or higher

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to provide a tool where users could gain hands-on experience with various first aid scenarios without needing to sign up for an in-person course. Users can use their controlers to interact with virtual characters to apply bandages, deal with head trauma, and more. The contents of the software are described in more detail below.

## Contents

This tool allows users to perform medical tasks in the following scenarios:

* Bandage application to small cuts and scrapes
* Bandage application to large wounds with heavy bleeding
* Heimlich maneuver to handle choking
* CPR
* Head trauma

For each of the above scenarios, users will first be trained on the task. Then, they will be tested in a timed testing run, where they must successfully complete each step in order before the clock runs out.


## Troubleshooting

If you have issues starting project, delete go to project's folder and delete Library folder.
